        <line>It was on my <del rend="strikethrough">is</del> sixteenth birthday</line>
        <line>that my Aunt received a letter from</line>
        <line>my father. I cannot describe the</line>
        <line>tumult of emotions that arose within</line>
        <line>me as I read it. It was dated from</line>
        <line>London; he had returned! I could only</line>

        <line>delicious to me were the words of his letter</line>
        <line>that concerned me: "I cannot tell you"</line>
        <line>it said, "how ardently I desire to see</line>

        <line>of my future life: She is all that</line>
