  <div class="intro-text"><p>In January of 1818, at the age of 19, Mary Shelley published <em>Frankenstein; or, 
    The Modern Prometheus</em>. Her first published novel, it would prove to be one of the most iconic ever written, 
    a classic of the Romantic period and Gothic form. Given the immediate and enduring popularity of her first novel, 
    one might expect her subsequent completed novel—<em>Mathilda</em>, composed in the latter half of 1819—to be welcomed 
    enthusiastically by readers. After all, the two texts share many characteristics besides authorship and contemporaneity: 
    both the Monster and Mathilda have been abandoned at birth and are (to put it mildly) overly concerned with their fathers, 
    metaphorical and literal; both novels contribute to the Gothic form through themes of incest, insanity, suicidality,
     monstrosity, and isolation; and both tales are epistolary. However, the reception of <em>Mathilda</em> was abortive from 
     the first. It was not published until 1959, 140 years after Shelley wrote it.</p>
