            <div class="collapse" id="intro">
              <p>William Godwin (1756-1836) was an English radical political philosopher of the French
            Revolutionary era and the head of one of Britain’s leading literary families. He married
            Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97), the early advocate of women’s rights, but she died
            shortly after the birth of their daughter Mary (1797-1851). Mary grew up to marry her
            father’s disciple, Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), and to write <em>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus </em>(1818).</p>
        <p>Godwin rose to fame with two books: <em>An Enquiry Concerning
                Political Justice</em> (1793), now seen as a founding text of philosophical
            anarchism, and <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794), one of the
            great novels of the eighteenth century. He also wrote five more full-length novels,
            works of educational theory, children’s books, plays, philosophical biographies, essays,
            political pamphlets—and a four-volume<em> History of the
                Commonwealth of England</em> (1824-8). Sociable on principle as well as by
            disposition, he knew or corresponded with almost everyone of note on the political left
            from the 1790s to the era of the Great Reform Bill (1832)—including nearly all the major
            literary figures of the period. Godwin’s greatest impact was in the debates following
            the French Revolution, but his influence has been through several revivals, and is
            currently rising again among scholars and political thinkers.<span id="Note1_return"><a

        <p><em>Caleb Williams</em> was published on 26 May 1794 under
            the title, <em>Things As They Are; or, The Adventures of
                Caleb Williams</em>. A second edition followed in 1796, and a third in 1797, each
            containing extensive revisions. Two more editions during Godwin’s lifetime (1816, 1831)
            repackaged the novel for nineteenth-century readers.<span id="Note2_return"><a

            retitled the novel <em>Caleb Williams </em>and included
            ‘Memoirs of William Godwin’ by Mary Shelley. Godwin’s celebrated account of the
            composition of <em>Caleb Williams</em> appeared in the
            ‘Preface to the Present Edition’ of the 1832 Bentley’s Standard Novels edition of <em>Fleetwood; or, The New Man of Feeling</em> (first
            published, 1805). Since then, <em>Caleb Williams</em> has
            never been out of print. Modern editors have nearly always adhered to the conventional
            choice of the last edition corrected in the author’s lifetime. An exception is Pamela
            Clemit’s edition in Volume III of <em>Collected Novels and
                Memoirs of William Godwin</em>, gen. ed. Mark Philp, 8 vols. (London: Pickering
            and Chatto, 1992), which is based on the first edition and includes a list of
            substantive variants from the manuscript and the four other lifetime editions. The first
            edition was preferred because it represented Godwin’s original intentions, while the
            list of variants provided a record of his changing ideas which could be studied
            separately. Clemit’s Oxford World’s Classics edition of <span style="font-style:italic"
                >Caleb Williams</span> (2009) made the 1794 text available for classroom use.</p>

              <p>Godwin died on 7 April 1836. In his will, he gave his daughter Mary Shelley authority ‘to

            catalogue at the British Museum shows that the manuscript of <em>Caleb Williams</em>, together with nine other Godwin
            manuscripts, was purchased by the Norfolk banker, antiquary, and collector Dawson Turner

              <p>The only previous study is in D. Gilbert Dumas, ‘Things as They Were: The Original Ending
            of <em>Caleb Williams</em>’, <em>Studies in English Literature</em>, 1500-1900, 6 (1966),
            575-97. He announced the discovery in the holograph manuscript of a first version of the
            novel’s ending, which Godwin cancelled in favour of the ending which appeared in the
            published novel. Most of Dumas’s article is devoted to a literary analysis of the two
            endings. There is a short bibliographical description of the manuscript in a footnote,
            which provides useful guidance but contains a few inaccuracies. Ever since Dumas, it has
            been the practice of editors of <em>Caleb Williams</em> to
            publish the manuscript ending in an appendix to the novel.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="intro2">
              <p>The manuscript is comprised of loose leaves mounted in a guard book. This method of
            binding loose leaves into volumes was used extensively throughout the nineteenth and
            twentieth centuries, and earlier. The guard book has sponge-marbled red boards
            (measuring approximately 265 x 227.5 mm), half-leather binding, and gilt decorations.
            Single leaves of Godwin’s manuscript are pasted onto stubs or guards of uniform height.
            The leaves are slightly smaller than the boards, and are positioned alternately higher
            or lower on the guards to keep their edges even. The guard book was evidently
            commissioned by Dawson Turner, rather than by the Godwin family. The binding closely
            resembles those of other manuscripts from Turner’s collection, including the three
            further Godwin holograph manuscripts at the V&amp;A, three Godwin holograph manuscripts
            in the Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the New York Public Library,

              <p>The manuscript is written in Godwin’s hand, which is nearly always clear and well formed.
            He wrote in black ink which has uniformly faded to a medium brown. The manuscript is
            undated and comprises 161 leaves of laid paper, trimmed to approximately 241 x 195 mm.
            The total number of leaves includes several smaller slips of paper used by Godwin for
            revisions to the text, and tipped to the guards in the same way as the whole leaves.
            Most of the leaves with identifiable, named watermarks were made by Edmeads &amp; Pine,
            or Floyd &amp; Co. </p>
        <p>Volume, chapter, and paragraph divisions were clearly marked by Godwin in the process of
            composition. Almost all of the leaves are paginated in Godwin’s hand, though leaves
            containing revised portions of text marked by Godwin for insertion are mostly paginated
            in another hand. There are three separate pagination sequences which correspond to the
            volumes in the published text.<span id="Note9_return"><a class="notelink"

            II, paginated 3-6 by Godwin, are misbound in Volume III; and pages 91-100 are missing
            from Volume III. Four pages from Volume III, three of them containing portions of the
            second ending, are misbound in Volume I (94a, 107a-108a, 109-10, and 115). One leaf in
            Volume I, paginated 74a, is misbound from the manuscript of Godwin’s <em>Political Justice</em>.</p>
        <p>Godwin made numerous revisions as he went along, or immediately on finishing a section or
            volume. The manuscript has numerous cancellations of words, sentences, and longer
            sections, with revisions between the lines, in the margins, and sometimes on separate
            leaves or scraps of paper, where portions of new or altered text are keyed to insertion
            points in the manuscript by asterisks, crosses, or other symbols. That this became
            Godwin’s habitual method of composition is corroborated by his letter to the publisher
            Archibald Constable about his 1817 novel, <em>Mandeville: A
                Tale of the Seventeenth Century in England</em>: ‘In finally looking over the
            manuscript for the press, I have been struck with the complexity of my insertions &amp;
            reinsertions in the few places where I found it most difficult to please myself in
                writing.’<span id="Note11_return"><a class="notelink"

                    href="#Note11"><sup>11</sup></a></span></p>
        <p>There is an abundance of printers’ marks throughout all three volumes of the manuscript
            (except on the pages containing the original, cancelled ending). They include the names
            of compositors responsible for setting particular sections of text (for example, ‘Morton
            begins’), and signature indications for typesetting (in a variety of hands) which
            correspond exactly to the signatures for the first edition. This confirms that the book
            was set in type from the present manuscript (and that the pages of the original ending
            were never submitted for printing). Further light is shed on Godwin’s practice of
            overseeing the printing of his novels by his correspondence with Constable, who insisted
            on setting type for <em>Mandeville</em> in Edinburgh,
            separating the sole manuscript from its author. Godwin explained that during the
            production of <em>Caleb Williams</em>, <em>St Leon: A Tale of the Sixteenth Century </em>(1799),
            and <em>Fleetwood</em>, he had been accustomed to close
            interaction with, and easy geographical access to, his printer: ‘my printer was in
            London; the manuscript was at the distance of three streets; &amp; upon any unforeseen
            emergence I could immediately have recourse to &amp; consult it.’<span

              <p>According to Godwin’s diary, he began writing <em>Caleb
                Williams</em> on 24 February 1793 (‘Write 1 page’), ten days after the publication
            of <em>Political Justice</em>. Over the fourteen months in
            which he was engaged on the novel, the war with France stimulated a powerful government
            reaction against British reformers, leading to judicial prosecutions, repressive
            legislation, and campaigns of intimidation by loyalist associations. Godwin returned to
            composition on 5 March (‘Write 7 pages’), after which he wrote steadily until 29 March,
            the day on which he proposed a Roman history to the publisher George Robinson, then

        <p>He began work on Volume III on 30 October 1793 (‘Write Vol. III, p. 1’), received

            Godwin’s writing was further disrupted in December by his visits to the imprisoned
            Scottish radicals Thomas Muir and Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who had been tried for sedition
            in August and September 1793 respectively, and were awaiting transportation to New South

            January 1794 (‘Write p. 21, 22, 23’) in order to begin an extended period of revision
            which lasted to the end of March.</p>
        <p>There is no further evidence about the nature of these revisions, but some light may be
            cast on them by his later account of his compositional method in his correspondence with
            Constable: ‘It has been my habit … to write with so much deliberation &amp; thought,
            that I have never hesitated to send my work to the press by the time the half of it was
            completed; &amp; as it drew to its conclusion, the printer &amp; the author generally
            finished within three days of each other’.<span id="Note17_return"><a class="notelink"

                    href="#Note17"><sup>17</sup></a></span> It is therefore possible that Godwin set
            aside Volume III in order to revise earlier volumes to send to the press. This phase of
            revision coincided with a period of intense engagement with persecuted radicals: he had
            frequent contact with the political reformer Joseph Gerrald, both before and after

        <p>Godwin resumed work on Volume III on 1 April (‘Write p. 24-28’) and wrote steadily until
            30 April 1794, when he recorded completing the manuscript (‘Write p. 112-117/2, fin.’).
            On the next day he revised, and for the next two days he did no work on the novel. From
            4 to 8 May, the following diary entries occur:</p>
        <p>4. Su. Write 1½ pages.</p>
        <p>5. M. Write 2 pages.</p>
        <p>6. Tu. Write 4 pages.</p>
        <p>7. W. Write 1 page: revise.</p>
        <p>8. Th. Write 1 page: revise.</p>
        <p>In a later memorandum of the composition of <em>Caleb
                Williams</em>, Godwin bracketed these entries together under the heading ‘new
            catastrophe’—referring to the rewritten ending which appeared in the published
                edition.<span id="Note19_return"><a class="notelink"

            pages, there is an exact correspondence between the notation of pages in the diary and
            the pagination of the manuscript. The present manuscript is evidently the one whose
            composition Godwin recorded and sent to press, and is hence the unique manuscript of
            this work.</p>

                            >visitors</span> that remarkable &amp; immortal man. Oh James how little

                        in mentioning them in the same sentence) Johnson. (Not Doctor Johnson!) He
                        sits in his little library in Gower Place surrounded by musty folios Quartos
                        &amp; octavos in plentiful abundance … He is all intellect—you <em>feel that</em> in looking at him—and the
                        slightest word he says <em>fixes</em> your
                        attention—for you feel <em>raised</em> by his
                        presence. He talks slowly—and his hands move meanwhile with a nervous
                        fidgettiness—which however does not appear or have vent in any other
                        way.—But I must defer a great deal about him to my next. He has visited me
