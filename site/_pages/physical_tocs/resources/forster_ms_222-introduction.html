              <p>William Godwin (1756-1836)
            was an English radical political philosopher of the French Revolutionary era and the
            head of one of Britain’s leading literary families. He married Mary Wollstonecraft
            (1759-97), the early advocate of women’s rights, but she died shortly after the birth of
            their daughter Mary (1797-1851). Mary grew up to marry her father’s disciple, Percy
            Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822), and to write <em>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus
            </em>(1818).</p><p>Godwin rose to fame with two books: <span style="font-style:italic"
                >An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</span> (1793), now seen as a founding text
            of philosophical anarchism, and <em>Caleb Williams</em> (1794), one of the great novels
            of the eighteenth century. He also wrote five more full-length novels, works of
            educational theory, children’s books, plays, philosophical biographies, essays,
            political pamphlets—and a four-volume<em> History of the Commonwealth of England</em>
            (1824-8). Sociable on principle as well as by disposition, he knew or corresponded with
            almost everyone of note on the political left from the 1790s to the era of the Great
            Reform Bill (1832)—including nearly all the major literary figures of the period.
            Godwin’s greatest impact was in the debates following the French Revolution, but his
            influence has been through several revivals, and is currently rising again among
            scholars and political thinkers.<span id="Note1_return"><a class="notelink"

            Property, edited by H. S. Salt, appeared in 1880. Twentieth-century editors have
            traditionally used the third edition as the main text; a facsimile of this edition, with
            a list of substantive variants from the first and second editions, was produced by F. E.
            L. Priestley (1946). This tradition changed with Mark Philp’s edition in Volumes III and
            IV of <em>Political and Philosophical Writings of William Godwin</em>, gen. ed. Mark
            Philp, 7 vols. (London: Pickering and Chatto, 1993). Philp’s text is based on the first
            edition and provides a list of substantive variants from the second and third editions
            (along with selected manuscript variants). The first edition was preferred because it
            captured Godwin’s original intentions, while the list of variants provided a record of
            his changing ideas which could be studied separately. Philp’s Oxford World’s Classics
            edition of <em>Political Justice </em>(2013) made the 1793 text available for classroom
            use.</p>

            <div class="collapse" id="intro3">
              <p>The manuscript is comprised of loose leaves mounted in three guard
                  books. This method of binding loose leaves into volumes was used extensively throughout
                  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and earlier. The guard book has sponge-marbled
                  red boards (measuring approximately 260 x 229 mm), half-leather binding, and gilt
                  decorations. Single leaves of Godwin’s manuscript are pasted onto stubs or guards of
                  uniform height. The leaves are slightly smaller than the boards, and are positioned
                  alternately higher or lower on the guards to keep their edges even. The guard books were
                  evidently commissioned by Dawson Turner, rather than by the Godwin family. The binding
                  closely resembles those of other manuscripts from Turner’s collection, including the
                  three further Godwin holograph manuscripts at the V&amp;A, three Godwin holograph
                  manuscripts in the Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the New York

            <div class="collapse" id="intro4">
              <p>The manuscript is written in Godwin’s hand, which is nearly
            always clear and well formed. He wrote in black ink which has uniformly faded to a
            medium brown. The manuscript is undated and comprises 629 leaves of laid paper, trimmed
            to approximately 240 x 192 mm: 216 in the first guard book, 214 in the second, and 199
            in the third. The total number of leaves in each guard book includes several smaller
            slips of paper used by Godwin for revisions to the text, and tipped to the guards in the
            same way as the whole leaves. Most of the leaves with identifiable, named watermarks
            were made by Buttanshaw; Curteis &amp; Sons; Edmeads &amp; Pine; S. Lay; or (in the
            third guard book only) ‘J. Whatman │ 1794’. </p><p>Book, chapter, and paragraph
            divisions were clearly marked by Godwin in the process of composition, as were
            side-notes indicating the subjects of particular sections of text. Most of the leaves
            are paginated in Godwin’s hand, though leaves containing revised portions of text marked
            by Godwin for insertion are mostly paginated in another hand. There are multiple
            pagination sequences across the whole manuscript. The manuscript in the first two guard
            books largely corresponds to the two volumes of the first edition of the published work
            (though there is some material for the second edition at the start of the first guard
            book and at the end of the second one). In the first two guard books, Godwin’s
            pagination is replaced at intervals by the same other hand to create more continuity in
            the pagination sequences.</p><p>In the third guard book, the first 90 leaves are
            paginated 51-190 by Godwin. These are followed by two leaves containing portions of
            revised text (paginated 21 and 22). A pencilled note in an unknown hand on the recto of
            the second of these leaves describes the remainder of the contents of the guard book as
            preliminary revisions: ‘This bundle appears principally loose sheets, &amp; rewritings
            of the same portions—or, probably, materials for 2<sup>nd</sup> &amp; 3<sup>rd</sup>
            Editions’. The bundle comprised several separate sequences of pagination in Godwin’s
            hand, some of which are in pencil, not all of which are fully legible, and some of which
            are replaced by pagination sequences in another hand.</p><p>Godwin revised the text as
            he went along, or immediately on finishing a section, chapter, or book. The manuscript
            has numerous cancellations of words, sentences, and longer passages, with revisions
            between the lines, in the margins, and sometimes on separate leaves or scraps of paper,
            where portions of new or altered text are keyed to insertion points in the manuscript by
            asterisks, crosses, or other symbols. That this became Godwin’s habitual method of
            composition is corroborated by a letter to the publisher Archibald Constable about his
            1817 novel, <em>Mandeville: A Tale of the Seventeenth Century in England</em>: ‘In
            finally looking over the manuscript for the press, I have been struck with the
            complexity of my insertions &amp; reinsertions in the few places where I found it most
            difficult to please myself in writing.’<span id="Note11_return"><a class="notelink"

                    href="#Note11"><sup>11</sup></a></span> Godwin made other revisions in the
            manuscript of <em>Political Justice</em> by patching slips of paper containing new text
            over passages to be replaced, using pieces of adhesive wafer, some of which are still
            partly or wholly attached. When revising or augmenting the text for the second and third
            editions, Godwin wrote new portions of text on loose sheets, indicating points for the
            insertion of new text by the phrase ‘letter press’, followed by the page numbers in the
            relevant edition of the published text.<span id="Note12_return"><a class="notelink"

            marks throughout the first two guard books and on the first 86 leaves of the third guard
            book. These include signature indications for typesetting and, in the second guard book,
            names of compositors responsible for setting particular sections of text. This confirms
            that the first edition of <em>Political Justice</em> was set in type from the present
            manuscript. Further light is shed on Godwin’s practice of overseeing the printing of his
            works by his correspondence with Constable, who insisted on setting type for
                <em>Mandeville</em> in Edinburgh, separating the sole manuscript from its author.
            Godwin explained that during the production of <em>Caleb Williams</em>, <em>St Leon: A
                Tale of the Sixteenth Century </em>(1799), and <em>Fleetwood; or, The New Man of
                Feeling </em>(1805), he had been accustomed to close interaction with, and easy
            geographical access to, his printer: ‘my printer was in London; the manuscript was at
            the distance of three streets; &amp; upon any unforeseen emergence I could immediately

            party. Godwin noted in his diary, ‘Carry the ms to Nicholson’ (14 April), followed by
            ‘Sup at Nicholson, revisal de mon ouvrage’ (29 April). His painstaking method of
            composition meant that he was able to send portions of the manuscript to the printer as
            he went along, noting on 16 May, ‘Send copy’, and on 22 May—the day after the issue of a

                          presence. He talks slowly—and his hands move meanwhile with a nervous
                          fidgettiness—which however does not appear or have vent in any other
