    <p>William Godwin’s <em>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em> was published in
two volumes on 14 February 1793. The work was composed between 15
September 1791 and 29 January 1793. It was revised for a second, and
then a third edition, published in 1796 and 1798 respectively.</p>

<p>S-GA contains the sole surviving manuscript of <em>Political Justice</em>
(MSL/1876/Forster/222), which also served as the printer’s copy. It
comprises 629 leaves containing the holograph manuscript of the first
edition of <em>Political Justice</em>, including revisions made as the work
progressed, together with an abandoned first draft and preliminary drafts
of materials for the second and third editions. The manuscript was
originally written on loose leaves. On Godwin’s death in 1836, the
manuscript was auctioned, along with fourteen others, in the sale of his
library. The guard books in which the manuscript of <em>Political Justice</em> is now
mounted were commissioned by its first purchaser, Dawson Turner.</p>
