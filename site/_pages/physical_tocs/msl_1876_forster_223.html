  <p>Godwin’s first full-length novel was published in three volumes under the
title <em>Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams</em> on 26 May
1794. The work was composed between 24 February 1793 and 10 May
1794. It was begun just ten days after the publication of Godwin’s <em>An
Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em>. Godwin revised <em>Caleb Williams</em> for a
second and a third edition, which appeared in 1796 and 1797
respectively, and for its reissue in a single volume in 1831, in Bentley’s
Standard Novels series.</p>

<p>S-GA contains the sole surviving manuscript of <em>Caleb Williams</em>
(MSL/1876/Forster/223), which also served as the printer’s copy. It
comprises 161 leaves containing the holograph manuscript of <em>Caleb
Williams</em>, including revisions made as the work progressed and a
cancelled ending. The manuscript was originally written on loose leaves.
On Godwin’s death in 1836, the manuscript was auctioned, along with
fourteen others, in the sale of his library. The guard book in which the
manuscript of <em>Caleb Williams</em> is now mounted was commissioned by its
first purchaser, Dawson Turner. The manuscript was described as having
‘a few leaves wanting’ at the time of sale.</p>
